This is the first blog post from the GitHub CMS. 😍 

What? GitHub CMS 🤔

Actually, there's no such thing. But we use GitHub as a data source.

### How?

We use the GitHub API to fetch this file inside a Next.js app. But we cannot use the API directly because, GitHub has a stric rate limit.
So, we use some static optimizations comes with Next.js to get around with that.
